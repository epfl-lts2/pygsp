r"""
The :mod:`pygsp.graphs` module implements the graph class hierarchy. A graph
object is either constructed from an adjacency matrix, or by instantiating one
of the built-in graph models.

Interface
=========

The :class:`Graph` base class allows to construct a graph object from any
adjacency matrix and provides a common interface to that object. Derived
classes then allows to instantiate various standard graph models.

Vertex-frequency transforms are implemented as filter banks and are found in
:mod:`pygsp.filters` (such as :class:`~pygsp.filters.Gabor` and
:class:`~pygsp.filters.Modulation`).

Import and export (I/O)
-----------------------

We provide import and export facility to two well-known Python packages for
network analysis: NetworkX_ and graph-tool_.
Those packages and the PyGSP are fundamentally different in their goals (graph
analysis versus graph signal analysis) and graph representations (if in the
PyGSP everything is an ndarray, in NetworkX everything is a dictionary).
Those tools are complementary and good interoperability is necessary to exploit
the strengths of each tool.
We ourselves leverage NetworkX and graph-tool to save and load graphs.

Note: to tie a signal with the graph, such that they are exported together,
attach it first with :meth:`Graph.set_signal`.

.. _NetworkX: https://networkx.github.io
.. _graph-tool: https://graph-tool.skewed.de

.. autosummary::

    Graph.load
    Graph.save
    Graph.from_networkx
    Graph.to_networkx
    Graph.from_graphtool
    Graph.to_graphtool

Others
------

.. autosummary::

    Graph.get_edge_list
    Graph.set_signal
    Graph.set_coordinates
    Graph.subgraph
    Graph.extract_components

Graph models
============

In addition to the below graphs, useful resources are the random graph
generators from NetworkX (see `NetworkX's documentation`_) and graph-tool (see
:mod:`graph_tool.generation`), as well as graph-tool's assortment of standard
networks (see :mod:`graph_tool.collection`).
Any graph created by NetworkX or graph-tool can be imported in the PyGSP with
:meth:`Graph.from_networkx` and :meth:`Graph.from_graphtool`.
