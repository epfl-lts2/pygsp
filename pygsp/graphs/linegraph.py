class LineGraph(Graph):
    r"""Build the line graph of a graph.

    Each vertex of the line graph represents an edge in the original graph. Two
    vertices are connected if the edges they represent share a vertex in the
    original graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : :class:`Graph`

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> graph = graphs.Sensor(5, k=2, seed=10)
    >>> graph
    Sensor(n_vertices=5, n_edges=6, k=2, distributed=False, seed=10)
    >>> line_graph = graphs.LineGraph(graph)
    >>> line_graph
    LineGraph(n_vertices=6, n_edges=10)
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    >>> fig, ax = graph.plot('blue', edge_color='blue', indices=True, ax=ax)
    >>> fig, ax = line_graph.plot('red', edge_color='red', indices=True, ax=ax)
    >>> _ = ax.set_title('graph and its line graph')
