class Gabor(Filter):
    r"""Design a filter bank with a kernel centered at each frequency.

    Design a filter bank from translated versions of a mother filter.
    The mother filter is translated to each eigenvalue of the Laplacian.
    That is equivalent to convolutions with deltas placed at those eigenvalues.

    In classical image processing, a Gabor filter is a sinusoidal wave
    multiplied by a Gaussian function (here, the kernel). It analyzes whether
    there are any specific frequency content in the image in specific
    directions in a localized region around the point of analysis. This
    implementation for graph signals allows arbitrary (but isotropic) kernels.

    This filter bank can be used to compute the frequency content of a signal
    at each vertex. After filtering, one obtains a vertex-frequency
    representation :math:`Sf(i,k)` of a signal :math:`f` as

    .. math:: Sf(i, k) = \langle g_{i,k}, f \rangle,

    where :math:`g_{i,k}` is the mother kernel centered on eigenvalue
    :math:`\lambda_k` and localized on vertex :math:`v_i`.

    While :math:`g_{i,k}` should ideally be localized in both the spectral and
    vertex domains, that is impossible for some graphs due to the localization
    of some eigenvectors. See :attr:`pygsp.graphs.Graph.coherence`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : :class:`pygsp.graphs.Graph`
    kernel : :class:`pygsp.filters.Filter`
        Kernel function to be centered at each graph frequency (eigenvalue of
        the graph Laplacian).

    See Also
    --------
    Modulation : Another way to translate a filter in the spectral domain.

    Notes
    -----
    The eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian (i.e., the Fourier basis) are needed
    to center the kernels.

    Examples
    --------
