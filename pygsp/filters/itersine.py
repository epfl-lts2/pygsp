class Itersine(Filter):
    r"""Design an itersine filter bank (tight frame).

    Create an itersine half overlap filter bank of Nf filters.
    Going from 0 to lambda_max.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
    Nf : int (optional)
        Number of filters from 0 to lmax. (default = 6)
    overlap : int (optional)
        (default = 2)

    Examples
    --------

    Filter bank's representation in Fourier and time (ring graph) domains.

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> G = graphs.Ring(N=20)
    >>> G.estimate_lmax()
    >>> G.set_coordinates('line1D')
    >>> g = filters.Itersine(G)
    >>> g
    Itersine(in=1, out=6, overlap=2.00)
    >>> s = g.localize(G.N // 2)
    >>> fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2)
    >>> _ = g.plot(ax=axes[0])
    >>> _ = G.plot(s, ax=axes[1])
